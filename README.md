## Description

This SwiftUI code defines a custom view with three lines arranged in a vertical stack (`VStack`). Each line is represented by a rectangle with specific transformations and animations applied. The lines respond to a tap gesture, triggering a smooth rotation (`isRotation.toggle()`) and a scaling animation (`isHidden.toggle()`) using the SwiftUI `withAnimation` block. The `Line` function encapsulates the styling of an individual line, employing a black foreground color and a rounded rectangle shape. The overall effect creates an engaging and interactive visual element, making it a playful addition to user interfaces. This code is concise, leveraging SwiftUI's declarative syntax and animation capabilities to achieve a dynamic and aesthetically pleasing result.
